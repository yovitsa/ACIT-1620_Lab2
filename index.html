  <h2 id="section-1">HTML</h2>
  <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
  
  
  <h5>Elements consist of</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>A tag name</li>
    <li>Required or optional</li>
  </ul>

  <p>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the  tag can be written as or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.</p>

<h5 class="VSC-explanation">In Visual Studio Code, you can autmatically format code by following these steps</h5>

<ol>
    <li>Type ctrl-shift-p (windows) or cmd-shift-p (mac) to open the Command Palette</li>
    <li>In The Command Pallete, type format</li>
    <li>From the results, choose Format Doucment</li>
</ol>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>

    <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations.</p>

    <p>For Example</p>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>The bind() method of Function instances creates a new function that, when called, calls this function with its this keyword set to the provided value, and a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.</p>

    <p>The Core client-side javaScript language consist of soem common programig features that allow you do things like:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Store useful values inside varibales</li>
        <li>Preform operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programing)</li>
        <li>Run Code in response to ertain events occuring on a web page - fro example, a user clinkng on a button</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="script.png" alt="JavaScript code snipet">

    <p>The bind() function creates a new bound function. Calling the bound function generally results in the execution of the function it wraps, which is also called the target function. The bound function will store the parameters passed — which include the value of this and the first few arguments — as its internal state.</p>

    <p>When using a bound function as the right-hand side of instanceof, instanceof would reach for the target function (which is stored internally in the bound function) and read its prototype instead.</p>
